# CheckTheNFT

## Problem:
Fake or Duplicated NFTs have become a growing problem, especially due to OpenSea's LazyMint feature (80% of LazyMinted NFTs are fake)

## Solution:
Create a verifying tool that buyers can use to check the reputability of an NFT by simply inputting its contract address and tokenID

## How to Use this Tool:
`python3 app.py` in /src/

Input the NFT's contract address and token id and submit for verification results.
